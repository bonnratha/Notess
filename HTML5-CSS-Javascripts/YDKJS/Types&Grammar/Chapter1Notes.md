- JS has SEVEN built in types. They are null, undefined, boolean, number, string, symbol (ES6), and object.
- All these types (except object) are called primitives.
- typeof operator return the type in string value.
- But null type returns as "object" with typeof operator.
- Function is referred to as callable object.
- Think of array as a subtype of the "object" built in type of JS.
- In JS, variables don't have type - values in them have types.
- Variables that have no value currently, actually have the "undefined" value.
- Understand the different between "undeclared" vs "undefined"
- The browser is basically the "window" object.
